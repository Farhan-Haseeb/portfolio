  "extraInfo": "For years, I’ve been building <strong>scalable</strong>, <strong>high-performance web applications</strong> that not only function seamlessly but also push boundaries. As a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, I thrive in dynamic environments where problem-solving and innovation take center stage. My expertise lies in <strong>React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, and microservices</strong>, and I’m always on the lookout for the next big challenge. <br><br> Lately, I’ve been diving deep into <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> and AI-driven applications. Exploring how LLMs can transform software development, automate processes, and enhance user experiences is something I’m incredibly passionate about. Whether it’s integrating AI into applications or fine-tuning models for specific use cases, I’m always eager to experiment and push the limits of what’s possible. Let’s connect and create something awesome together!",
